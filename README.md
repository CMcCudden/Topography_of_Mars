My biggest interests are virtually anything to do with space and working with satellites- and I've been wanting to teach myself 
more about GIS and working with maps. So this little project is a two-fer for me. Taking the .tif file from [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mars/GlobalSurveyor/MOLA/Mars_MGS_MOLA_Shade_global_463m),
the code turns the .tif into a topographical map with some location markers. I intend to do some for Mercury and Venus soon.
